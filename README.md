# IS310_Final_Project
hello 
For my project, I want to explore twitch and the numerous communities that can be found on the platform. I want to create data visualizations to map how diverse twitch is and whether there is any overlaps in those communities. I plan to use existing data from twitchtracker and Twitch API to gather new data for this project. Iâ€™ll be working on this with @Jerry.
